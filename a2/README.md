# Assignment 2 - The Basics of HTML 

This exercise introduces you to more HTML basics.

## Assignment details

Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Merge this repository into your fork. In order to do this, you'll have to make a pull request on your fork. A pull request is simply saying "I want to merge this code into this repository. I'm going to request that I can do that so we can review it and decide if it's a good idea".
    * Go to your repo on Github and click `New Pull Request`
    * Click `compare across forks`.
    * Choose your repo and your master branch as the base fork and choose this repo and master as the head fork.
    * Click `Create pull request`. Usually at this point we would look at the pull request and decide if it's a good idea to merge it or not. Feel free to do that and them click `Merge pull request`.
    * Pull down your new code to your local machine.
2. This exercise has roughly the same starter code as the first one. Feel free to get familiar with it again. The main difference is that I've supplied a `style.css` file and made sure that the server will supply that to the client if asked for it.
3. Edit `index.html` to your liking. You must, however, use the following HTML5 elements:
    * An image
    * A table
    * A list
    * An anchor
    * A div
    * A span
4. Edit `style.css` so that it has:
    * Class selectors
    * ID selectors
    * Multiple classes on one tag
    * CSS that changes the position of an element
    * Some kind of font styling
    * Pseudoclasses
5. Use a decent color scheme
6. Test your porject to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly.
7. Deploy your project to Heroku.
