# Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Heroku  

This assignment is a "warm-up" exercise. You will edit your first webpage and then deploy it to a platform called Heroku. Heroku is a platform that allows us to easily host servers and websites. We will continue to use Heroku as we get to more advanced exercises because it's easy to use, free, and convenient. 

Refer to [Getting started with node.js on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction).

## Assignment details

Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Since this is the first assignment, you should set up your repository for all of your exercises. In order to do that, you should Fork this repository. Forking a repository simply creates a copy that lives under your account. You want this copy so you have access to commit and push changes to it.
    * This exercise contains a number of files:
        * `server.js` is the code for the web server
        * `Procfile` is used for Heroku deployment
        * `index.html` is your HTML file, most of your changes for this exercise will be done here
2. Edit `index.html` so it includes the following information about yourself. Note that you should not include any information that you do not want publicly available on the internet since it will be when we deploy to Heroku.
    * Your name
    * Your hobbies
    * Your interests
    * Why you want to build websites
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly.
4. Deploy your project to Heroku.
