Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Heroku  
===

This assignment is a "warm-up" exercise. 
You will simply deploy the starting Web site that you will use this term to the [Heroku Web platform](http://www.heroku.com/). 

Refer to [Getting started with node.js on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction).

(Thanks to past instructors of the course, here is a short [getting started with Heroku movie](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gpollice/Movies/HerokuGettingStarted/) that may also help.)

Treat this assignment as a chance to get up to speed on Git, GitHub, and Heroku. If you already know these, great. However, if you're new to them, spend several hours practicing, experimenting, and reading documentation. In other words, don't just get your website up and done. You will need skill with these tools throughout the rest of the course.

Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Clone the starting project code. This repo contains:
    * the server code, `server.js`
    * the `Procfile` that you need for Heroku deployment
    * A starting `index.html` file that you will edit as described below
2. Edit `index.html` to show the following information about you:
    * your name and class (e.g. class of 2020) Note: Do not put any contact or personal information that you do not potentially want other people outside of this class to see.
    * your major(s) and minor(s)
    * interests in Computer Science
    * your experience with the following technologies and methods (none, some, a lot)
        * HTML
        * CSS
        * Java
        * JavaScript
        * Ruby
        * Python
        * unit testing
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly.
4. Deploy your project to Heroku.
5. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme (guide follows) so we can find it.
