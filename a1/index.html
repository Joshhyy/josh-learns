"> my hobbies include playing games with friends, designing clothes, and binging netflix shows. </p>
<p/> My interests are: 
learning about new things such as coding, music, design, business I like to have a little knowledge on a lot of things. </p>
<p/> The reason I would like to build websites is to not only hopefully start up a clothing company using mostly online sales, but be able to manage and run the tech side of the company as well. I would also like to be able to help friends/families/local businesses with having their own funcitonal, aesthetically pleasing websites. </p>
